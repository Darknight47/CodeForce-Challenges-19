Blackslex is designing a log-in system for Gean Dev and discovered that most users use weak passwords.

To resolve this issue, he posed the following conditions, dependent on two variables k and x, for all passwords. Each password is a string s of length n satisfying these properties.

s uses only the first k lowercase letters of the English alphabet.
For every pair of indices 1≤i<j≤n such that (j−i) is divisible by x, the letters si and sj are different.
Find the smallest integer n such that no valid string of length n exists.

Input
The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) — the number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers k and x (1 ≤ k ≤ 26, 1 ≤ x ≤ 15).

Output
For each test case, output the minimal n.

Input:
3
2 1
3 2
1 5

Output:
3
7
